    <hr />
    <p>
      I am originally from Corpus Christi, Texas. At the age of 18 I enlisted into the Army and was stationed here in the PNW.
      After 10 years of service I decided to stay in Washington because I enjoy the outdoors and the weather. Since leaving the military I went right into the civilian workforce. For the past three years I have worked mainly in Marketing, Social Media, and Design.

      My education consists of the School of Hard Knocks aka The Army and some college courses at Pierce College in Lakewood, WA. My goals are to complete all code courses at Code Fellows and earn my way to becoming a web developer in the tech industry.
